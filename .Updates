Version 0.2 (May 17, 2019)
*Fixes:
    --Stopped cards from randomizing to nothing
    --Fixed a crash that happens if you don't use all the optional randomizer codes (now they're really optional)
    --Deck name now randomizes the entire name
    
*Added Fairies to Shop Card Randomizer
    --Fairy rewards are random cards

Note that you will have to get all of the codes again, not just the main and ShopCard+FairyCards codes
    
Still working on more optional codes :D

Version 0.1 (April 27, 2019)

*Added the Main randomizer
    --Randomizes Starting Cards, Chests with cards, card rewards, cards given by NPCs and Trash Cans
    --Gives cards needed to complete certain levels in those levels (Example: Puts Hellhound in your second deck when you enter
      Fossil Boneyard and abort with the same deck, removes hellhound when you enter another level)

*Added Shop Card randomizer
  --Randomizes which cards will appear in the Kadishu shop (will add the Grenfoel shop soon)
  
*Added Buy Value Randomizer
  --Randomizes how much cards will cost to buy in the shop (Dark Raven might cost 500)
  --Numbers are between 50 and 5,000 for now. That may be changed in the future for balancing reasons

*Added Enemy Cards Randomizer
  --Randomizer the cards other card users will use (Leod III might use a Pegasus card instead of UberBomberbot)
  --Formerly known as "Secret Randomizer"
  
  Currently working on more! :D
